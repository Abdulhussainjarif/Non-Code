### What is Markdown and how it is different from html...

Let's talk about markdown

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. It is a plain text document should be readable without tags and but there is
a way to add text modifiers like list, bold, italics etc. To make words bold using Markdown, you simply enclose them in * (asterisks). So, *bold word* would look like 
bold word when everything is said and done. All told, Markdown is a great way to write for the web using plain text. 

Markdown is easy to learn and fast to use. Markdown is almost always faster than writing with a rich text editor, especially when you start getting into things like links
or bulleted lists, which either make you use the mouse or force you to memorize a complicated sequence of keyboard shortcuts. One caveat is that if you need complicated 
text elements, such as tables, you’re better off sticking to HTML. Fortunately, Markdown has full HTML support, so you can code a table in HTML and go right back to 
Markdown in the same document. Plus, it’s much easier to read raw Markdown than it is to read raw HTML. Which, you know, was part of the reason Markdown was even invented.

Markdown does have its own filename extension: .md, but it was designed to be perfectly readable as a raw text file. So it’s safe to say that Markdown isn’t going anywhere.
You might expect that Markdown’s use has stalled as rich text becomes more and more popular, but that’s actually incorrect. Markdown’s presence has only grown since its 
introduction, and it continues to do so.Markdown is the unofficial standard on popular coding sites such as GitHub. It is also the default formatting option for popular 
communication tools such as Skype, Slack, and (to a lesser extent) Facebook Messenger. Wikipedia even uses a modified Markdown syntax they call wikitext. In a world of 
social coding that’s only becoming more social, the programmer who doesn’t know Markdown will find themselves at a disadvantage (or, at the very least, confused for a 
little while). So learning Markdown is not bad, if for no other reason than so you can keep up with the industry. That's all.

### How Markdown is different from HTML...

Now, if you’re going to be writing HTML, you should just…write HTML. But if you’re, say, writing an email or a readme file where you need HTML’s formatting options but not 
the full breadth of its features, Markdown is perfect.Markdown converts to HTML flawlessly, sparing you the hassle of opening and closing all those tags. There are so 
many tags in HTML to remember but if you use Markdown you will be free from that. Markdown is easier to write and it is easier for everyone to read than HTML. Writing 
HTML by hand is more painstaking and laborious due to its semantic tags for each element. However, HTML is so expressive and there some features in HTML, which is not 
possible in markdown.

Here are some examples how Markdown is different from HTML:
