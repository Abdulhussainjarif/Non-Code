## Crowdsourcing

In 2009, Google shifted to crowdsourcing – a sophisticated, quicker and much more reliable technique of obtaining real-time traffic data. 

Below is a simplified illustration of how crowdsourcing works:

#### How does crowdsourcing help Google collect traffic data?

Crowdsourcing is a very interesting sourcing model to collect information. 

It works like this… suppose you want to provide real-time updates on traffic conditions to users. You first develop an application where users can get directions to places, i.e. a GPS. program. However, in order for a user to get information about the current traffic conditions, she would also have to (anonymously) share her own geographic location with the app. Aside from that one user, there are many other users who want traffic updates of the same route. Therefore, all of them would be required to share their geographic location with the app to access the traffic conditions on a given road.

This way, you (as the app developer) would get loads of information about a particular geographic location, including the number of active users in that area, the speeds of various automobiles where your app is currently in use (through GPS satellites), the “density” of automobiles and a number of other data points. Using all this information, you would provide real-time traffic updates to all of your app’s users by first obtaining information from them.

This is how crowdsourcing works – you take information from your app’s users, create an aggregate of data, do some quick analysis and then transmit meaningful, actionable information back to your users.

This is precisely how Google tells you about the traffic conditions in your precise area. Once you toggle ‘My Location’ on in Google Maps, you will automatically start sending your location data to Google’s servers.

 When Google sees that there are a few slow-moving vehicles (or a lot of slow-moving, Maps-bearing smartphones) in a particular area, it indicates this with a yellow line on Maps.
 
 Similarly, if there has been an obstruction or a diversion resulting in a proper traffic jam, it indicates this hindrance with a red line in Maps.

It is important to note that Google claims that the sharing of your smartphone location is completely anonymous, so Google doesn’t know the exact source of the incoming information. This is extremely important, as it results in a reliable, secure ecosystem where users can share information for the collective good without compromising their own privacy.
