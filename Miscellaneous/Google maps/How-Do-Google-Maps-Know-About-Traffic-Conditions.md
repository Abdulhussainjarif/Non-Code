## How Do Google Maps Know About Traffic Conditions?
Google Traffic works by crowdsourcing data from users who have toggled their location to ‘on’ in the Google Maps app.

Google collects information about the current traffic conditions on any given road/highway from its own users who are sharing their geographic location with the app.

This way, Google can provide real-time traffic updates to all of its Maps app users by first obtaining information from them.

Google used to rely on traffic sensor data, but now it collects traffic-related information from its own users who have toggled their location to ‘on’ in the Google Maps app.

Google has a special built-in feature called Google Traffic on its Maps app that shows traffic conditions in real-time on major roads in particular geographic locations. If you have the Google Maps app on your smartphone (or any other electronic device), you can access info on the current traffic conditions on any given road/highway.
