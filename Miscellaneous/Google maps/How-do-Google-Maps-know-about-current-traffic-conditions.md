## How do Google Maps know about current traffic conditions?

#### Traffic sensors

Until 2009, Google collected data from traffic sensors and cameras on the roads that were mostly installed by government transportation agencies and certain private companies that compiled traffic data for various purposes. 

The traffic sensors used laser radar or active infrared technology that could detect how fast the overall traffic was moving by observing the general size and speed of automobiles. This information was then transmitted to servers, and regular traffic updates could then be announced.

Google also obtained data from these sources and embedded it in their Maps app to inform users of the traffic conditions.

##### Drawbacks:
- The sensors were only installed on important streets, i.e. the roads that were most prone to traffic.
- With traffic sensors, updates were not available on the current traffic on a particular road instantaneously on smartphones or others.
